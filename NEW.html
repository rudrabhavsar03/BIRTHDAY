                                <p class="indent-8">You know I never start my letters with "dear" coz deva and I had an inside joke of dear hehe but you, you're my dearest from day 1. I still remember the Saturday first I met you, a normal boy who gave me training...however that five-corner closing shift we had together was the day I knew that this person has something! I was always forced to trust you, I always felt how deeply you understand people and situations that was something I always liked about you so much and the honesty you have for whatever you do is something that inspired me a lot.</p>
                                
                                <p class="indent-8">Back to story so yaa ofc thanks to dosi who invited me to his "boyfriend's birthday randomly the same day and in the beginning I was unsure about it but then I like to make new friends so yaa obv I was going to come. That day first time I saw someone drink so much and not blackout lol. Then your birthday, fuck I still feel embarrassed about being so underdressed :( but still my jadiya was looking so cute..</p>

That night I knew this man is a gentleman, whoever will be his partner will be lucky and hehe I am the luckiest. The Niagara trip broo that was something I will never forgive in my life. You bitch you why did you look at me like that the whole trip??? Best experience ever. And my love then all the invitations to have food and spend time together ufff!!
