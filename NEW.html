        <p>
          You know I never start my letters with “dear” coz deva and I had an inside
          joke of dear hehe but you, you’re my dearest from day one.
          I still remember the first Saturday I met you…
        </p>

        <p>
          Back to the story — of course thanks to dosi who invited me to his boyfriend’s
          birthday. That day somehow changed everything for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          New Year’s Day… I don’t know how easily I just told everything to you,
          without fear, without hesitation.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then — 10th April. You happened to me.
          I’m genuinely happy that we are together.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6 font-medium">Lots of love,</p>
        <p class="font-bold text-right text-2xl">Your Bacchaa ❤️</p>
